* Hardware Design Files and Documentation for the ROHM BD71815AGW-EVK-101 EVK

----
### Description: 
* BD71815AGW is a single-chip power management IC for battery-powered portable devices. 
* The IC integrates 5 buck converters, 8 LDOs, a boost driver for LED, and a 500mA single-cell linear charger. 
* Also included is a Coulomb counter, a real-time clock (RTC), a 32 kHz crystal oscillator and a general-purpose output (GPO).
* The ICs buck converters supply power to the application processor as well as system peripherals such as DDR memory, wireless modules, and touch controllers. 
* These regulators maintain high efficiency over a wide range of current loads by supporting both PFM and PWM modes.
* They also operate at a high switching frequency of 6MHz, which allows the use of smaller and cheaper inductors and capacitors. 
* The regulator supplying the processor core also supports Dynamic Voltage Scaling (DVS).
